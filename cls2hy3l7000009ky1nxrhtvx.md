File manipulation is a fundamental skill for anyone working with the command line. In this blog, we'll explore how to compare and manipulate file content using `find`, `grep`, `awk`, and `sed`. Regular expressions will be our trusty companion throughout, enhancing the power and flexibility of these commands.

### **The Role of Regular Expressions**

Before diving into specific commands, let's understand the importance of regular expressions. Regular expressions, often abbreviated as regex, are patterns that define a search. They enable us to express flexible and complex search criteria, making them invaluable for text processing.

### **Find Command**

The `find` command is excellent for locating files based on various attributes. When combined with regex, it becomes a potent tool for precision searches.

**Example 1: Find all text files in the current directory**

```bash
find . -type f -regex ".*\.txt"
```

**Example 2: Find files modified within the last 7 days**

```bash
find . -type f -mtime -7
```

**Example 3: Find files starting with "report"**

```bash
find . -type f -regex "./report.*"
```

**Example 4: Find all directories containing "data"**

```bash
find . -type d -name "*data*"
```

**Example 5: Find files with names matching a specific pattern**

```bash
find . -type f -name "file[0-9].txt"
```

### **Grep Command**

`grep` is a versatile tool for searching text patterns within files. It's an indispensable command for quickly isolating relevant information.

**Example 1: Search for lines containing "error" in a log file**

```bash
grep "error" logfile.txt
```

**Example 2: Search for lines starting with "warning" in multiple files**

```bash
grep "^warning" *.log
```

**Example 3: Search for lines not containing "success" in a file**

```bash
grep -v "success" data.txt
```

**Example 4: Search for lines with words starting with "cat" in a file**

```bash
grep "\<cat" animals.txt
```

**Example 5: Search for lines with exactly 8 characters in a file**

```bash
grep -E "^.{8}$" passwords.txt
```

### **Awk Command**

`awk` is a powerful text processing tool that operates on a per-line basis. Regular expressions enhance its ability to extract and manipulate data.

**Example 1: Print the second column of a CSV file**

```bash
awk -F, '{print $2}' data.csv
```

**Example 2: Print lines containing more than 3 fields in a file**

```bash
awk 'NF > 3' report.txt
```

**Example 3: Replace "apple" with "orange" in the third column of a file**

```bash
awk '{gsub(/apple/, "orange", $3); print}' fruits.txt
```

**Example 4: Print lines where the first column starts with "A"**

```bash
awk '$1 ~ /^A/' names.txt
```

**Example 5: Calculate and print the average of the numbers in the second column**

```bash
awk '{sum+=$2} END {print sum/NR}' numbers.txt
```

### **Sed Command**

`sed` is a stream editor used for text transformations. Regular expressions make it a robust tool for search and replace operations.

**Example 1: Replace all occurrences of "apple" with "orange" in a file**

```bash
sed 's/apple/orange/g' filename.txt
```

**Example 2: Delete lines containing the word "obsolete"**

```bash
sed '/obsolete/d' data.txt
```

**Example 3: Append " - Processed" to lines starting with "Task:"**

```bash
sed '/^Task:/ s/$/ - Processed/' tasks.txt
```

**Example 4: Replace the first occurrence of "blue" with "red" on each line**

```bash
sed 's/blue/red/' colors.txt
```

**Example 5: Insert a new line after lines containing "important"**

```bash
sed '/important/a\New Line Inserted' notes.txt
```

Regular expressions, when coupled with these commands, provide a powerful toolkit for anyone dealing with file content manipulation in the command line. Mastering these concepts will significantly enhance your efficiency and effectiveness in handling textual data.
