In Azure, there are several ways to create resources, each with its own advantages and considerations. Here are some of the most common methods:

1. **Azure portal:** This is a web-based, user-friendly interface for managing Azure resources. It's great for beginners and for performing single, ad-hoc tasks. However, it can be time-consuming for managing large numbers of resources.
    
2. **Azure PowerShell:** This is a set of cmdlets for managing Azure resources directly from the PowerShell command line. PowerShell is powerful and flexible, making it a good choice for complex deployment and management tasks.
    
3. **Azure CLI:** The Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) is another command-line tool for managing Azure resources. It's cross-platform and has a syntax that is easier to understand than PowerShell.
    
4. **Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates):** These are JSON files that define the resources you need to deploy for your solution. ARM templates can be used to deploy your resources consistently and repeatedly.
    
5. **Azure SDKs:** Azure provides SDKs for several programming languages, including .NET, Java, Python, and more. With these SDKs, you can manage Azure resources programmatically.
    
6. **Azure REST APIs:** With the REST APIs, you can interact with Azure services and resources directly over HTTP, from any platform that can send an HTTP request.
    

Each of these methods has its own use cases and advantages, and the best method for you will depend on your specific needs and context.

## Practical Aspects and Use Cases

**Azure portal:** As a user-friendly interface, Azure portal is excellent for educational purposes or performing individual tasks. However, for large-scale operations or resource management, it may not be the most efficient.

**Azure PowerShell:** Azure PowerShell is ideal when dealing with complex deployment tasks, or when needing to automate and streamline operations. Advanced users with PowerShell scripting knowledge can benefit greatly from this method.

**Azure CLI:** The Azure CLI is best for those who prefer a command-line interface but want something simpler than PowerShell. It's also ideal for users working across different platforms.

**ARM templates:** ARM templates are perfect for situations where you need to deploy multiple resources consistently. By using these templates, you can ensure that your resources are set up the same way every time, reducing human error.

**Azure SDKs:** SDKs are best for developers working in specific programming languages who want to integrate Azure resource management into their code.

**Azure REST APIs:** REST APIs are for applications that need to communicate directly with Azure services, and are often used when building custom applications.

**Terraform:** Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool, provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services. It's a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

## Comparison Table

| Method | Ease of Use | Flexibility | Use Case | Writing Format |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <mark>Azure portal</mark> | High | Low | Single, ad-hoc tasks | GUI |
| Azure PowerShell | Medium | High | Complex deployment and management tasks | PowerShell scripting |
| <mark>Azure CLI</mark> | Medium | Medium | Cross-platform command-line operations | Command-line instructions |
| <mark>ARM templates</mark> | Low | High | Consistent and repeated deployments | JSON |
| Azure SDKs | Medium | High | Programmatic resource management | Various (depends on the SDK language) |
| Azure REST APIs | Low | High | Custom applications | HTTP/JSON |
| <mark>Terraform</mark> | Medium | High | Infrastructure as code, large-scale deployments | HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) |

## Industry Practices

In industry practice, a combination of these methods is typically used. Azure portal might be used for quick tasks or checking the status of resources, while PowerShell or CLI could be used for more complex operations. ARM templates and Terraform are commonly used for setting up infrastructure consistently across different environments, while SDKs and REST APIs are used when integrating Azure functionality into other software applications.
