In this article, we will explore various **file and directory manipulation tasks** in a Linux-based terminal.

* *Viewing File Contents:* To view what's written in a file (fruits.txt)
    

```bash
[~]$ cat fruits.txt
```

*Changing Access Permissions:* To change the access permissions of files (for example, make the file executable only for the owner)

```bash
[~]$ chmod u+rwx,g-rwx,o-rwx filename # Replace 'filename' with the actual file name
[~]$ chmod 700 filename # Replace 'filename' with the actual file name
```

| <mark>Bit</mark> | <mark>Purpose</mark> | <mark>Octal Value</mark> |
| --- | --- | --- |
| r | Read | 4 |
| w | Write | 2 |
| x | Execute | 1 |

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">while using octal code like <strong>xyz</strong>, where <strong>x</strong> gives permission for the <strong>user</strong> or <strong>owner</strong>, <strong>y</strong> talks about <strong>group</strong> &amp; <strong>z</strong> tells about <strong>others</strong>.</div>
</div>

Examples for more clarity:

* Full access for Owner, add read, remove execute for group and no access for others
    

```bash
[~]$ chmod u+rwx,g+r-x,o-rwx test-file
```

* Provide full access to Owners, group and others
    

```bash
[~]$ chmod 777 test-file
```

* Provide Read and execute access to Owners,groups and others
    

```bash
[~]$ chmod 555 test-file
```

* Read and Write access for Owner and Group, No access for others.
    

```bash
[~]$ chmod 660 test-file
